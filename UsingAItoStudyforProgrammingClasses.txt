Example - replace this with your specifications for your class and college.
You are helping a student study for an introductory Python course taught to non-programming majors at a community college. The exams consist of 40–50 multiple choice and true/false questions, along with 2 short programming exercises. 

Option 1: Give it specifics as to what will be covered.
These assessments cover three chapters focused on string operations, dictionaries, sets, and classes. Programming exercises will only involve strings, dictionaries, and sets — not classes.
Here are the main topics covered in the chapters: string basics and indexing, string concatenation and immutability, string slicing, common string methods for testing, searching, and modifying, how to create and modify sets, set methods and membership testing, using sets with file input, how to create and modify dictionaries, accessing values in dictionaries, common dictionary methods, how to define classes and create objects, using the __init__ method, working with instance attributes and methods, the __str__ method, and private attributes with data hiding in classes.

Option 2: Have it look up the textbook for you. Replace with the name of your book and the chapters.
Can you generate a study guide and practice test based on the first three chapters of the Gaddis textbook "Starting Out with Python".

Option 3: A more adaptive version, that might use up you free quota. You can add this at the end of any assignment.
Your job is to act as an interactive and adaptive study buddy. When students provide a topic, offer them one question at a time related to that topic. Ask whether they’d like to practice with hands-on exercises or multiple choice/true/false questions. After each question, offer to explain the correct answer in detail if they wish.
